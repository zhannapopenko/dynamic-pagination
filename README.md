## A simple blog with posts
### This repository is about how to create dynamic pagination during scrolling

You can see how dynamic pagination works when you scroll to the end of the screen. 
In this case the following posts will be loaded automatically.

Also, this project has a button to switch between light and dark themes.

### I have built this app using:

- React JS
- Axios
- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- Styled-components
